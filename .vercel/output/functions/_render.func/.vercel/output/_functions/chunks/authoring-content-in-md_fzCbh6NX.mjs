Frontmetter is set at the top of your files between `---` separators.\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: Sample\n---\n\nPage content goes here, after `---`.\n```\n\nEvery page must include at least a `title`. See the [frontmatter reference](/reference/frontmatter-ref) for all available fields and how to add custom fields. \n\n## Inline styles\n\nText can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.\n\n```md\nText can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.\n```\n\nYou can [link to another page](/getting-started).\n\n```md\nYou can [link to another page](/getting-started).\n```\n\nYou can highlight `inline code` with backticks. \n\n```md\nYou can highlight `inline code` with backticks. \n```\n\n## Images\n\nImages in CelestialDocs use [Astro's built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/).\n\nMarkdown and MDX support the Markdown syntax for displaying images that includes alt-text for screen readers and assistive technology.\n\n![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)\n\n```md\n![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)\n```\n\nRelative image paths are also supported for images stored locally in your project.\n\n![A kitty in space](../../../assets/KittyAstronaut.svg)\n\n```md\n![A kitty in space](../../../assets/KittyAstronaut.svg)\n```\n\n## Headings\n\nYou can structure content using a heading. Headings in Markdown are indicated by a number of # at the start of the line.\n\n### How to structure page content in CelestialDocs\n\nCelestialDocs is configured to automatically use your page title as a top-level heading and will include an “Overview” heading at top of each page's table of contents. We recommend starting each page with regular paragraph text content and using on-page headings from `<h2>` and down:\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: Markdown Guide\ndescription: How to use Markdown in CelestialDocs\n---\n\nThis page describes how to use Markdown in CelestialDocs.\n\n## Inline Styles\n\n## Headings\n```\n\n### Automatic heading anchor links\n\nUsing headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: My page of content\ndescription: How to use CelestialDocs's built-in anchor links\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nI can link to [my conclusion](#conclusion) lower on the same page.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n`https://my-site.com/page1/#introduction` navigates directly to my Introduction.\n```\n\nLevel 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings will automatically appear in the page table of contents.\n\nLearn more about how Astro processes heading ids in the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids).\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.\n>\n> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.\n\n```md\n> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.\n>\n> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.\n```\n\n## Code blocks\n\nA code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ``` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.\n\n```js\n// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.\nvar fun = function lang(l) {\n  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);\n  return true;\n};\n```\n\n\n````text\n```js\n// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.\nvar fun = function lang(l) {\n  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);\n  return true;\n};\n```\n````\n\n## Details\n\nDetails (also known as “disclosures” or “accordions”) are useful to hide content that is not immediately relevant. Users can click a short summary to expand and view the full content.\n\nUse the standard HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements in your Markdown content to create a disclosure widget.\n\nYou can nest any other Markdown syntax inside a `<details>` element.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>\n\nThe [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `-40°`.\n\n</details>\n\n```html\n<details>\n<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>\n\nThe [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `-40°`.\n\n</details>\n```\n\n## Other common Markdown features\n\nCelestialDocs supports all other Markdown authoring syntax, such as lists and tables. See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet from The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements.";
