Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently. Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed. CelestialDocs supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

## Callout

The \`Callout\` component is designed to highlight important information, warnings, errors, or successes in your application. It is a versatile alert box with customizable variants and titles.

<Callout>
  See the [Callout](/custom-components/callout) for all custom props and their usages. 
</Callout>

## Card

You can display content in a box matching CelestialDocs' styles using the \`<Card>\` component.

<Card title="Card with Custom Icon and Color" icon={Cat} color="Red">
  This is a card with a custom icon and color.
</Card>`,s={title:"Components",author:"saumilthecode",draft:!1,tags:[],hide_breadcrumbs:!1,hide_toc:!1,hide_sidenav:!1,max_width:!1},a={type:"content",filePath:"/Users/tkrobot/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/BBSSHack-Revamped/src/content/docs/Custom Components/index.mdx",rawData:void 0};export{a as _internal,e as body,t as collection,s as data,o as id,n as slug};
