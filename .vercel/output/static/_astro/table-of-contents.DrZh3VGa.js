## Hide Table of Contents

### Hide globally

In \`config.js\`, you can hide table of contents by keeping the value of \`hide_table_of_contents\` as \`true\`. This will hide the ToC for all pages. 

\`\`\`js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_table_of_contents: true,
  ...
};
\`\`\`

### Hide locally

To hide ToC for specific pages only, then add \`hide_toc\` in the frontmatter as \`true\`.

\`\`\`yaml
---
hide_toc: true
---
\`\`\``,a={title:"Table of Contents",author:"saumilthecode",draft:!1,tags:[],hide_breadcrumbs:!1,hide_toc:!1,hide_sidenav:!1,max_width:!1},s={type:"content",filePath:"/Users/tkrobot/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/BBSSHack-Revamped/src/content/docs/Guides/table-of-contents.mdx",rawData:void 0};export{s as _internal,o as body,n as collection,a as data,e as id,t as slug};
